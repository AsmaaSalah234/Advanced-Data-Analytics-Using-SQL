# Advanced-Data-Analytics-Using-SQL
This project presents a comprehensive data analysis of a company's sales data using SQL. The goal is to extract actionable insights that help understand business performance over time, identify trends, and support strategic decisions. The analysis is structured into several key areas, each serving a different business purpose and utilizing appropriate SQL techniques.

Throughout the project, I applied a wide range of SQL functions such as date functions, window functions, and conditional logic to perform robust and insightful analysis.

## The main analyses performed include:

# Change Over Time Analysis:
To visualize how sales metrics evolve over time, identify growth patterns, and detect seasonality in the business.

Purpose:
    - To track trends, growth, and changes in key metrics over time.
    - For time-series analysis and identifying seasonality.
    - To measure growth or decline over specific periods.
SQL Functions Used:
    - Date Functions: DATEPART(), DATETRUNC(), FORMAT()
    - Aggregate Functions: SUM(), COUNT(), AVG()
```sql
-- Analyse sales performance over time
-- Quick Date Functions
SELECT
    YEAR(order_date) AS order_year,
    MONTH(order_date) AS order_month,
    SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_key) AS total_customers,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM gold.fact_sales
WHERE order_date IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY YEAR(order_date), MONTH(order_date)
ORDER BY YEAR(order_date), MONTH(order_date);

-- DATETRUNC()
SELECT
    DATETRUNC(month, order_date) AS order_date,
    SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_key) AS total_customers,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM gold.fact_sales
WHERE order_date IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY DATETRUNC(month, order_date)
ORDER BY DATETRUNC(month, order_date);

-- FORMAT()
SELECT
    FORMAT(order_date, 'yyyy-MMM') AS order_date,
    SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_key) AS total_customers,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM gold.fact_sales
WHERE order_date IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY FORMAT(order_date, 'yyyy-MMM')
ORDER BY FORMAT(order_date, 'yyyy-MMM');
```

# Cumulative Analysis

Purpose:
    - To calculate running totals or moving averages for key metrics.
    - To track performance over time cumulatively.
    - Useful for growth analysis or identifying long-term trends.

SQL Functions Used:
    - Window Functions: SUM() OVER(), AVG() OVER()
    ```sql
    -- Calculate the total sales per month 
-- and the running total of sales over time 
SELECT
	order_date,
	total_sales,
	SUM(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) AS running_total_sales,
	AVG(avg_price) OVER (ORDER BY order_date) AS moving_average_price
FROM
(
    SELECT 
        DATETRUNC(year, order_date) AS order_date,
        SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales,
        AVG(price) AS avg_price
    FROM gold.fact_sales
    WHERE order_date IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY DATETRUNC(year, order_date)
) t

# Performance Analysis (Year-over-Year, Month-over-Month)
Purpose:
    - To measure the performance of products, customers, or regions over time.
    - For benchmarking and identifying high-performing entities.
    - To track yearly trends and growth.

SQL Functions Used:
    - LAG(): Accesses data from previous rows.
    - AVG() OVER(): Computes average values within partitions.
    - CASE: Defines conditional logic for trend analysis.

Analyze the yearly performance of products by comparing their sales 
to both the average sales performance of the product and the previous year's sales 
```sql
--Analyze the yearly performance of products by comparing their sales 
--to both the average sales performance of the product and the previous year's sales 
WITH yearly_product_sales AS (
    SELECT
        YEAR(f.order_date) AS order_year,
        p.product_name,
        SUM(f.sales_amount) AS current_sales
    FROM gold.fact_sales f
    LEFT JOIN gold.dim_products p
        ON f.product_key = p.product_key
    WHERE f.order_date IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 
        YEAR(f.order_date),
        p.product_name
)
SELECT
    order_year,
    product_name,
    current_sales,
    AVG(current_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY product_name) AS avg_sales,
    current_sales - AVG(current_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY product_name) AS diff_avg,
    CASE 
        WHEN current_sales - AVG(current_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY product_name) > 0 THEN 'Above Avg'
        WHEN current_sales - AVG(current_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY product_name) < 0 THEN 'Below Avg'
        ELSE 'Avg'
    END AS avg_change,
    -- Year-over-Year Analysis
    LAG(current_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY product_name ORDER BY order_year) AS py_sales,
    current_sales - LAG(current_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY product_name ORDER BY order_year) AS diff_py,
    CASE 
        WHEN current_sales - LAG(current_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY product_name ORDER BY order_year) > 0 THEN 'Increase'
        WHEN current_sales - LAG(current_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY product_name ORDER BY order_year) < 0 THEN 'Decrease'
        ELSE 'No Change'
    END AS py_change
FROM yearly_product_sales
ORDER BY product_name, order_year;
```
